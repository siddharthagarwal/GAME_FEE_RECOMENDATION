# GAME_FEE_RECOMENDATION

Here, I have picked up a well known porblem in Online Gaming Industry where based on the User's History of Gaming interactions and it's respective ENTRY FEES that the user is ready to pay, I have developed a RECOMENDATION ENGINE which not only suggests subsequent games but also the respective Tournament Size (ENTRY FEES) based on the user's win-history and playing temperament.

Data:
When a user logs in to the platform, they have to choose from a variety of
tournament types (A / B / C / D). Additionally, different entry fees may be associated with every
tournament. As a platform we must ensure that the most relevant tournaments are suggested to
the user based on their preferences.
Available Data: Given anonymised user gameplay data in the form of 3 csv files.

Fields in the data are as described below:
Gameplay_Data.csv contains following fields:
● Uid: Alphanumeric unique Id assigned to user
● Eventtime: DateTime on which user played the tournament
● Entry_Fee: Entry Fee of tournament
● Win_Loss: ‘W’ if the user won that particular tournament, ‘L’ otherwise
● Winnings: How much money the user won in the tournament (0 for ‘L’)
● Tournament_Type: Type of tournament user played (A / B / C / D)
● Num_Players: Number of players that played in this tournament
Wallet_Balance.csv contains following fields:
● Uid: Alphanumeric unique Id assigned to user
● Timestamp: DateTime at which user’s wallet balance is given
● Wallet_Balance: User’s wallet balance at given time stamp
Demographic.csv contains following fields:
● Uid: Alphanumeric unique Id assigned to user
● Installed_At: Timestamp at which user installed the app
● Connection_Type: User’s internet connection type (Ex: Cellular / Dial Up)
● Cpu_Type: Cpu type of device that the user is playing with
● Network_Type: Network type in encoded form
● Device_Manufacturer: Ex: Realme
● ISP: Internet Service Provider. Ex: Airtel
● Country
● Country_Subdivision
● City
● Postal_Code
● Language: Language that user has selected for gameplay
● Device_Name
● Device_Type

We'll build a basic recommendation system which is able to rank/recommend relevant
tournaments and entry prices to the user.

The main objectives would be:
1. A user should not have to scroll too much before selecting a tournament of their
preference
2. We would like the user to play as high an entry fee tournament as possible.

As part of my project, I have included the following components in my notebook itself:
● Code
● Documentation which outlines the solution approach, assumptions, success metrics
● Areas of improvement
